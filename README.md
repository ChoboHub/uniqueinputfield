## INSTALLATIOn

1. Upload the 'uniqueinputfield' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Unique Text Input", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now add the "Unique Text Input" field to your sections.


## USAGE

- Behaves identically to a normal text input, however it enforces uniqueness and you cannot group the output in Data Sources.

- Two modes allow you to choose between throwing an error, "This must be unique", or attempting to make the handle unique automatically by appending an number, E.G. `my-entry-handle-2`
